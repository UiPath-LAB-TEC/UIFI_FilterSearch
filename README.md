Working with information in different applications can be tedious. Also, automating the process can raise problems on the long term as many applications suffer updates and the UI can change quite often

The Air Filter process asks the user for an input value to be entered using an UiPath Form. Once it has the filter name, it connects to a webpage where it searches for the corresponding filter using UI Automation. At the end, a PDF file is presented and using OCR, UiPath extracts the data.
